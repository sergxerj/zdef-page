bootstrap and javascript explanation: Bootstrap was used mainly for the navbar, and the cards in the index page, aside from that, used sparingly in some elements and for styling buttons.There wasn't much point in using javascript, so I just added a script that auto-selects in the request-form page the course selected in a course list page, that is passed as a query string in the URL.
